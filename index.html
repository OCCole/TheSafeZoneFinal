<h2>About Us</h2>

Cause/Mission:
   <p>Our mission is to support the LGBTQ+ community by providing locations of
   community centers in every state; offering links to supportive websites, groups, contacts,
  and foundations; listing information about some different gender identities and sexual orientations;
   and offering support through our own chat bot. We here at The Safe Zone hope to bring
   those who find themselves in the LGBTQ+ community together,and enforce support among the community
    as well as its allies.
